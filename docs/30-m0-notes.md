# M0 implementation notes

Running log of what was found while executing the [M0 breakdown](20-implementation-plan.md) §9. Things go
here when they invalidate a plan assumption or settle an open risk, so the plan and `docs/10` §17 stay
accurate rather than aspirational.

## Step 1 — vendoring **(done, `419fe9f`)**

Done as specified in AD-14: `external/dynarmic` at `e77b1ba`, nine submodules flattened, nested `.git`
removed, every licence swept into `external/PROVENANCE.md` and `REUSE.toml`. All permissive, none GPL.

**U-6 closed as a side effect.** Both `RbCodeCache` backends already exist upstream under MIT
(`oaknut/code_block.hpp` anon-mmap forms, `oaknut/dual_code_block.hpp` `memfd_create` + dual `MAP_SHARED`
RW/RX). Only `Interpreted` is new work. See `docs/10` §8.3.

## Step 2 — first build **(blocked on a dependency decision, diagnosed to the line)**

Toolchain facts established on this machine, worth not rediscovering:

- The NDK CMake toolchain file works; `ANDROID_ABI=x86_64 -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-26` configures
  past compiler detection.
- `cmake` and `ninja` both come from the SDK and are **not on PATH**; `-G Ninja` fails with "unable to
  find a build program" unless `-DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=$SDK/cmake/3.31.6/bin/ninja.exe` is passed
  explicitly. Same for `cmake.exe` itself, and for `android.jar`, which is under `platforms/` not
  `build-tools/`.

**Blocker: `external/dynarmic/CMakeLists.txt:151` — `find_package(Boost 1.57 REQUIRED)`.** This was not in
any Phase 0 document, so it is not in the licence table either. Ten files use it, for two things, and
neither is incidental:

| Boost use | Where | Why RetroBug cares |
|---|---|---|
| `boost::icl::interval_set<u32>` + `discrete_interval::closed` | `backend/arm64/a32_interface.cpp:71,162`, `a32_address_space.{h,cpp}`, and the x64 equivalent via `backend/block_range_information.{h,cpp}` | **This is the self-modifying-code invalidation tracking** — the mechanism AD-7/C10 chose instead of `userfaultfd`, because it is the one that also works on iOS. It is load-bearing for correctness of any guest that JITs or self-modifies |
| `boost::variant` | `ir/terminal.h`, `common/variant_util.h`, `ir/opt/a64_merge_interpret_blocks.cpp` | IR block terminal kinds — every tier reads this |

Boost is BSL-1.0, so this is a build-weight and maintenance question, **not** a licensing problem.

### The two ways forward

**A. Supply Boost.** Vendor a header-only subset (or fetch it in CI). Unblocks the build fastest.
Cost: `boost::icl` fans out transitively across a large part of Boost (`concept_check`, `mpl`,
`preprocessor`, `rational`, `container_hash`, `numeric/traits`, …), so a hand-picked subset is fragile —
in practice this means carrying most of a Boost tree as a build dependency for the rest of the project.

**B. Patch Boost out.** `boost::variant` → `std::variant` is mechanical. The interval container is roughly
one `patches/dynarmic/0001-*.patch` of ~150–250 lines with its own unit tests: `interval_set` here needs
only insert-with-merge, iterate, and containment — a sorted `std::vector<pair<u32,u32>>` with overlap
coalescing. Cost: a day, plus the responsibility for a data structure on the SMC path — which is also the
argument for owning it, since we would otherwise be trusting our correctness story to a container we
cannot audit quickly.

**Resolution (step 2 done).** The owner chose "patch Boost out", and the implemented shape turned out to be
better than either option above: instead of editing dynarmic at all, `compat/` provides the eight Boost
names as headers on the include path, and `cmake/FindBoost.cmake` answers `find_package(Boost REQUIRED)`
with an `IMPORTED` `Boost::boost` target pointing there. So **the vendored tree stays genuinely
byte-identical** — no patch files to rebase — and `-DRB_USE_REAL_BOOST=ON` swaps back to real Boost with
one flag. `external/dynarmic` builds clean for x86_64 Android: **114 MB `libdynarmic.a`**, A32 front end
and x64 backend objects present, no Boost installed.

Three things the shim needed that are worth knowing before touching it again:

1. `boost::recursive_wrapper<T>` cannot alias to `T`. dynarmic's `ir/terminal.h` declares the `Terminal`
   variant while `If`/`CheckBit`/`CheckHalt` are only forward-declared, and `std::variant` computes its
   traits at that point. The shim holds a `unique_ptr<T>` and converts to `const T&` on use, exactly the
   trick Boost uses.
2. `boost::variant` needs to be a *derived* type, not an alias, because dynarmic calls the member
   `which()`. Consequence: `std::visit` cannot deduce through a derived type, so `apply_visitor`
   down-casts explicitly.
3. Real Boost headers drag in `<map>`, `<set>`, `<tuple>`, `<array>`, `<functional>`, `<vector>`, and
   dynarmic's backend headers rely on that without including them. Without the same transitive surface the
   error is "too few template arguments for class template 'map'" in an unrelated header — confusing at a
   distance, so the includes are there deliberately and commented as such.

**Not yet done:** `core/tests/interval_compat_test.cpp` compiles and links but **has not been executed**,
so the interval containers are unverified. They are on the SMC path, where the failure mode is stale
translated code rather than a crash, so running them is the first thing this list owes. The emulator boot
for it is in flight.

## Standing environment facts (so they are not re-derived)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Host compiler for Windows binaries | **none** (`gcc`/`cc`/`clang`/`cl` all absent) → M0 tests are x86_64 **Android** binaries in the emulator |
| Emulator acceleration | AEHD 2.2 installed and usable; AVD `Medium_Phone` exists |
| Emulator image | `android-37.1/google_apis_playstore_ps16k/x86_64`, `abilist=x86_64,arm64-v8a`, **`abilist32=` empty** |
| `openat2`/`io_uring`/`landlock` from an app | unavailable (outside bionic's `SYSCALLS.TXT` allowlist) — see `docs/research/05` §1.4 |
| Executable memory from an app | permitted: `allow appdomain self:process execmem;` (`private/app.te:189`, read directly) |
| Exec from app-writable files | forbidden: `app_neverallows.te:69-73` (read directly) → why AD-5 ships one pre-built agent `.so` |
